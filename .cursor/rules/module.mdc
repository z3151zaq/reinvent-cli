# Module-Level Rules for CLI Project

## 1. Interface Design
- Expose only necessary functions and classes from each module.
- Use clear, consistent naming for exported symbols.
- Document all public interfaces with JSDoc.

## 2. Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies; prefer built-in modules when possible.
- Explicitly declare all dependencies in package.json.
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules.

## 3. Extensibility
- Design modules to be easily extensible and reusable.
- Use dependency injection or configuration objects for flexibility.

## 4. Comments
- Add module-level comments describing the module's purpose and usage.
- Document all exported functions and classes with JSDoc.

## 5. Testing
- Each module should have its own test file(s).
- Cover all exported functions and classes with unit tests.
- Test for both normal and edge cases.

## 6. Best Practices
- Keep modules focused and cohesive.
- Avoid tight coupling between modules.
- Regularly review module dependencies and refactor as needed.
- Ensure modules are easy to extend and maintain.

## 7. Documentation
- Each module must have a README.md with usage examples and API description.
- Document all configuration options and environment variables.
