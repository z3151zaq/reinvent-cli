# File-Level Rules for CLI Project

## 1. File Structure
- Each file should have a single responsibility.
- Group related functions and classes together.
- Place imports at the top and exports at the bottom of the file.

## 2. Naming
- Use descriptive, consistent file names (e.g., kebab-case or camelCase).
- File names should reflect their main purpose or exported entity.

## 3. Imports/Exports
- Use explicit imports and exports; avoid wildcard imports.
- Export only what is necessary for other modules.

## 4. Comments
- Add a file-level comment at the top describing the file's purpose.
- Use inline comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- Use JSDoc for all exported functions and classes.

## 5. Testing
- Each file containing logic should have corresponding test coverage.
- Test all exported functions and classes.
- Place test files in a `__tests__` or similar directory structure.

## 6. Best Practices
- Keep files small and focused.
- Refactor large files into smaller, logical units.
- Avoid duplicate code across files.
- Regularly review and clean up unused code.
