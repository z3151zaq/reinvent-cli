# Function-Level Rules for CLI Project

## 1. Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the function's purpose.
- Use verbs for functions (e.g., `getUser`, `calculateTotal`).

## 2. Parameters and Return Values
- Validate all input parameters; provide default values where appropriate.
- Always document parameter types and return values using JSDoc.
- Avoid functions with too many parameters; use objects for complex inputs.

## 3. Error Handling
- Use try/catch for operations that may throw errors.
- Return meaningful error messages; never expose sensitive data.

## 4. Comments
- Every public function must have a JSDoc comment with @param, @returns, and @example.
- Add inline comments for non-obvious logic.
- Use English for all comments.

## 5. Testing
- Write unit tests for all public functions.
- Test for both valid and invalid input.
- Use mocks/stubs for external dependencies.

## 6. Best Practices
- Keep functions pure and side-effect free when possible.
- Limit function length; refactor long functions into smaller ones.
- Avoid deeply nested logic.
- Regularly review and refactor functions for clarity and maintainability.
